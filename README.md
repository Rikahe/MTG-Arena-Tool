  - [Latest Stable Version](https://github.com/Manuel-777/MTG-Arena-Tool/releases/latest)

Once downloaded the installer should simply install and run immediately. The app will read your user data and warn you if anything goes wrong.

### Linux/Gnome users
After Gnome 3.26, legacy tray icons were deprecated, so users will need to install `libindicator-gtk3` to see the icon again. (packages are available in all managers)
